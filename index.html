<h1>Welcome to my living room!</h1>
<p>I live in a one bedroom basement appartment with my boyfriend. The living space and the kitchen are a part of one big room. This is where we spent most of our time. We cook meals together, watch movies, work, study, and relax all in one place. </p>
<p>My favourite part of the living room is the area where we store our books and boardgames. We both love playing boardgames and have a pretty big collection of them. In september of last year we did not have a place to store them so I went out and bought this bookshelf:</p>
<p>Since acquiring the bookshelf, this area of the house has become my favourite. I often look at the shelf and it reminds me of all the great time I've spend playing boardgames with my friends and my boyfriend.</p>
