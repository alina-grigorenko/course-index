                <p class="text1">The authors Becca Abbe and John-Patrick Hartnett share a similar point of view regarding the ethical and environmental problems discussed in their articles. “The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement” talks about the current state of the world’s sustainability crisis. Abbe points out that many people do not realize that the internet is a part of our physical world and has a large environmental impact on our planet. Companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other tech giants store hundreds of terabytes of data which takes up real resources and land. According to Abbe, we have two choices: we can continue to be a part of the current structure of the internet and exhaust global resources, eventually leading to the total collapse of our civilization. Or we can set new, more sustainable and ethical standards to how the internet should be used and run. Similarly, to Becca Abbe, John-Patrick Hartnett leaves his readers with two choices about designers’ dependability on industry-standard technology and software. Hartnett provides an overview of how the present-day graphic design practice is imprisoned by two of the biggest corporations in the world of design – Apple and Adobe. With limited competition, Apple and Adobe have gained full control of the graphic design industry and are restricting the level of ownership, freedom, and autonomy designers have over their tools. John-Patrick Hartnett proposes two choices: continue to allow Adobe and Apple to be the industry leaders in graphic design. Or, set out on a new path of open-source technology and tools for design practice. Both authors give examples of how we can operate more ethically and sustainably when it comes to these issues, meaning that they are opposed to them. Some of the examples include self-hosting websites on a single device, like Low Tech is currently doing it and using open-source software like Paper.js.

                I often hear that to be a graphic designer you do not need to be able to draw. I disagree. I think it is important for graphic designers to be able to illustrate their ideas clearly. I find that drawing my ideas out on paper before I begin working digitally helps me a lot in my design process. Drawing on paper is also a great way to brainstorm new ideas quickly.</p>

                <div class="title2">Reading Discussion II: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</div>
                <p class="text2">I agree with Lialina's opinion that replacing the word 'user' with 'person' could be dangerous. The term 'person' when it comes to describing individuals who are using and interacting with technology of any kind is simply too broad. Therefore, Lialina's implementation of the term 'universal user' instead of the term 'user', that many design professionals deem outdated, makes perfect sense. The author's definition of the term aligns with how I and many others are currently using technology. Many users are breaking boundaries created within hardware and software and are not always using them for their intent but rather to achieve their own goals. The term 'universal user' also helps understand and advocate for Schwult's argument for individual websites. Just as the universal user's abilities and ways of using technology are endless, websites create limitless possibilities for the users. 
                <br><br>
                As previously stated, I believe I am a universal computer user. The quote, 'Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it' deeply resonates with the way I use the internet and computers in general. I was able to relate to the many examples Lialina provides in her article. I have a Twitter account but I mainly use it to visit accounts I am interested in, instead of following them. I often listen to Youtube videos instead of watching them, as I like to multitask. I use Discord as some sort of diary where I write notes to myself more often than communicating with others, or as an image transfer service when I need to send an image from my iPhone to my PC that does not support AirDrop. I see computers as the universe. There is a lot we know about the universe, some argue that we know more information about it than the oceans. However, there is so much we have yet to discover as the universe is vast and greatly unexplored. Same with computers. There is a lot of information I have learned about them over the years. But there is so much more to them that I have yet to learn and discover. Therefore, the possible use of them is almost as vast as the universe itself.

                <p class="text3">Through my research, I found many open source software that performed the functions of the existing, industry-standard tools like Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, etc, for free. However, I wanted to learn about tools that perform tasks I have not done before, which inspired me to look into tools like React, Leanardo, and FontForge. ReactLinks to an external site. is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of writing web-based, single-page applications. It was made for front-end developers and designers to ease the process of creating interactive UI as it is easy to learn and implement within code. The website provides documentation and tutorials on the use of the language to speed up the learning process. Another open-source tool that could be highly useful to a designer is LeanardoLinks to an external site.. Leanardo is a colour palette building tool that generated a set of colours based on the target contrast value. It is great for generating dynamically accessible colour palettes for web design. Besides creating the colour palettes it provides designers with a visual of how the colours will look on certain UI components. The last tool I looked at is FontForge. FontForge is a font editing and designing software. It allows designers to create open-type, true-type, and postscript font designs. 
                <br><br>
                While doing my research on open-source tools I also found a great community of designers, called Open Source DesignLinks to an external site.. Their goals are to push for more open design processes and open-source software. They provide a great list of open-source resources for design as well as support the design community by funding, advocating, showcasing, and improving open-source tools and technology. 
                <br><br>
                I think open source principles can be applied to my design practice by opening the design process. This can be done by displaying all of the stages of my design process to other designers to share my knowledge, as well as receive critique and learn from them. Another way to apply this principle is by being open to collaboration with other designers and even professionals outside of the design field.</p>
